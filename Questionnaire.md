# Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
### I use easy to find public api for fetching prices, but the number from binance seems not quite right

# Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
### I do not think so. I made it in a rush.

# If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
### I believe 100 connections/second is ok for this web application.

# What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation?
### Quite a lot, like a better front-end, better refactoring of components.
